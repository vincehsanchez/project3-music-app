### Notes to consider:
- On my worksation, my conda enviornment is up in vscode, so I can run flask.
- When in VScode make sure you open the whole flask blog folder and then run flask.
- If you change anything, make sure to save first then restart/refresh flask (there is a green refresh/swirl to click) it
  helped me (at least I think it did) to minimize troubleshooting.
