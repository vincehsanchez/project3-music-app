- on my mac i make sure i have my conda enviornment up in vscode, then run flask.
- When in VScode make sure you open the whole flask blog folder and then run flask.
- if you change anything make sure to save first then restart/refresh flask (there is 
- a green refresh/swirl to click) it helped me anyway when I though something did not 
- show up when really flask was still running the previous code.
