on my mac i make sure i have my conda enviornment up in vscode, then run flask.
When in VScode make sure you open the whole flask blog folder and then run flask.
if you change anything make sure to save first then restart/refresh flask (there is 
a green refresh/swirl to click) it helped me anyway when I though something did not 
show up when really flask was still running the previous code.
